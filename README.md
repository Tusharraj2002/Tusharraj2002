🚍 Bus Route Visualizer: Shortest Path Finder
Welcome to the Bus Route Visualizer, a captivating web application that helps you find the shortest path between bus stops in Muzaffarpur. This project leverages advanced algorithms(Dijkstra) to visualize the most efficient routes dynamically. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a fantastic tool for visual learners and those interested in graph theory.

🌟 Features:
Dynamic Pathfinding: Choose your start and target nodes to visualize the shortest path.
Algorithm Visualization: Watch Dijkstra algorithms in action as they find the optimal path.
Real-time Distance Updates: The distance between nodes updates dynamically to reflect the most current data.
Interactive Interface: Intuitive design makes it easy to navigate and interact with the visualizer.
Custom Node Names: Uses the city of names of bihar for a localized and relevant experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling and making the application visually appealing.
JavaScript: For implementing the pathfinding algorithms and dynamic updates.
